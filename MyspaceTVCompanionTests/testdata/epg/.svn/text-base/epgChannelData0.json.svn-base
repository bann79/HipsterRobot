Since 2010, the UK has shivered through two record-breaking cold winters and experienced intense droughts and torrential floods. It is a pattern that seems to be playing out across the globe, with Texas seeing record-breaking rainfall followed by record-breaking drought. Horizon follows the scientists who are trying to understand what has been happening to our weather and investigates if these extremes are a taste of what is to come.",

He tells the teams to take a look around; they are surrounded by graffiti, and this is what they will be selling next. The teams each have one day to meet and convince up-and-coming urban artists that they are the right team to represent them in a one-off gallery sale. As the candidates meet an edgy bunch of artists, two different schmoozing techniques emerge. When both teams clash over the same artist, a project manager goes into meltdown and ends up taking a big risk. When the galleries open, modestly-priced graffiti and monster pictures with even bigger price tags prove hard to shift. But some art does appeal and, when prints and paintings begin to fly off the walls, some surprising top sellers emerge.",
