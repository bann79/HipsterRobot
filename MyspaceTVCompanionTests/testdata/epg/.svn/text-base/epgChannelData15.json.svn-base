The team with the highest score at the end of the show faces the final challenge, the manic Ball Room - a giant cube filled with balls that are blasted into the air. The winners take home the ultimate money-can't-buy prize - the super, shiny, springy, gold Copycats trophy, as well as securing their place in game show history.",
